🧑‍💻 I'm a Product Software Engineer, a progress-driven & self-taught fast learner with a constant thirst for technical improvement. <br />
💪 I Love building software to solve real-world problems for businesses and customers with a “Product-minded” mental model in mind. <br />
👨‍🎨 Also love building UI at scale to improve User Experiences

😁 I work across the entire stack: Frontend, Backend, but I specialize in Frontend (JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next, Performance and Accessibility, and more).

🌱  I’m currently learning: UI UX Web Design, diving deep into backend engineering, dev-ops, and cloud, then ML...
🔭  I have a [technical blog](https://howardphung.hashnode.dev/) where I write about fullstack web development, and more.
